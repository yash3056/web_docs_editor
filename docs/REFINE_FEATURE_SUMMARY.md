# Refine Selected Text Feature Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented the "Refine the selected text" feature to replace the "AI Writing" option in the context menu, with a submenu containing various text refinement options.

## Changes Made

### 1. HTML Changes (`docseditor/docseditor.html`)
- Replaced the "AI Writing" context menu item with "Refine the selected text"
- Added a "New" badge to highlight the feature
- Implemented a submenu with 6 refinement options:
  - Rephrase
  - Shorten
  - More formal
  - More casual
  - Bulletize
  - Summarize

### 2. CSS Changes (`docseditor/docseditor.css`)
- Added submenu styling with proper positioning
- Implemented hover effects for submenu items
- Added "New" badge styling
- Added disabled state styling for when no text is selected
- Improved visual feedback with hover effects

### 3. JavaScript Changes (`docseditor/docseditor.js`)

#### Selection Preservation Fix
- Fixed the bug where text selection was lost on right-click
- Added `savedSelection` property to store selection range and text
- Implemented `restoreSelection()` method to restore selection after context menu interaction

#### Context Menu Updates
- Updated `updateContextMenuState()` to handle the refine text option
- Replaced AI Writing handler with refine text submenu handlers
- Added proper enable/disable logic based on text selection

#### New Methods Added
- `handleRefineText(action)` - Main handler for refine actions
- `restoreSelection()` - Restores previously saved text selection
- `refineSelectedText(text, action)` - Calls AI API with appropriate prompts
- `replaceSelectedText(newText)` - Replaces selected text with refined version

### 4. API Client Changes (`shared/api-client.js`)
- Added `generateText(prompt, context)` method
- Configured to use classification server on port 8000
- Proper error handling and response parsing

## Features Implemented

### Text Refinement Options
1. **Rephrase** - Rewrites text while keeping the same meaning
2. **Shorten** - Makes text more concise
3. **More formal** - Converts to formal tone
4. **More casual** - Converts to casual tone
5. **Bulletize** - Converts text to bullet points
6. **Summarize** - Creates a summary of the text

### Bug Fixes
- **Selection Preservation**: Fixed the issue where selected text became unselected on right-click
- **Context Menu State**: Proper enable/disable of menu items based on selection
- **Error Handling**: Added proper error handling for API failures

## Technical Details

### Selection Preservation Implementation
```javascript
// Store selection on context menu show
this.savedSelection = {
    range: selection.getRangeAt(0).cloneRange(),
    text: selection.toString()
};

// Restore selection when needed
restoreSelection() {
    if (this.savedSelection && this.savedSelection.range) {
        const selection = window.getSelection();
        selection.removeAllRanges();
        selection.addRange(this.savedSelection.range);
        this.editor.focus();
        return true;
    }
    return false;
}
```

### AI Integration
- Uses the existing classification server's `/generate-text` endpoint
- Sends contextual prompts based on the selected refinement action
- Handles both success and error responses gracefully

## Testing
- Created `test-refine.html` for basic functionality testing
- Includes API connectivity test
- Provides sample text for testing different refinement options

## Usage Instructions
1. Select text in the editor
2. Right-click to open context menu
3. Click on "Refine the selected text" (with "New" badge)
4. Choose from the submenu options:
   - Rephrase, Shorten, More formal, More casual, Bulletize, Summarize
5. The selected text will be replaced with the refined version

## Requirements
- Classification server must be running on port 8000
- Server must have the `/generate-text` endpoint available
- User must have text selected for the feature to be enabled

## Error Handling
- Shows notification if no text is selected
- Handles API failures gracefully with error messages
- Falls back to cursor insertion if selection restoration fails
- Provides user feedback through notification system

The implementation successfully addresses both the feature request (replacing AI Writing with Refine Selected Text) and the bug fix (preserving text selection on right-click).
