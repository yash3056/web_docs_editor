# Version Control

The Web Docs Editor includes a comprehensive version control system that tracks document changes, manages versions, and provides collaboration features similar to professional development tools.

## Version Control Overview

### What is Version Control?
- **Change Tracking**: Automatically tracks all document modifications
- **Version History**: Maintains complete history of document versions
- **Rollback Capability**: Restore previous versions when needed
- **Collaboration Support**: Manage changes from multiple contributors
- **Branch Management**: Create separate branches for different document versions

### Benefits
- **Data Protection**: Never lose work due to accidental changes
- **Change Visibility**: See exactly what changed between versions
- **Collaboration**: Multiple people can work on documents safely
- **Experimentation**: Try changes without fear of losing original content
- **Audit Trail**: Complete record of who changed what and when

2. **Create New Branch**: Click "Create New Branch" button
3. **Branch Details**:
   - Branch name (required)
   - Description (optional)
4. **Create**: New branch created from current version

### Branch Operations
- **Switch**: Change to different branch for editing
- **Merge**: Combine changes from one branch into another
- **List View**: See all available branches
- **Branch History**: Track changes within each branch

## Comparing Versions

### Version Comparison Tool
1. **Access Compare Tab**: Go to version control → Compare Versions
2. **Select Versions**: Choose two versions to compare
3. **Side-by-side View**: See both versions simultaneously
4. **Difference Highlighting**: Changes highlighted between versions

### Comparison Features
- **Visual Differences**: Clear highlighting of changes
- **Content Alignment**: Corresponding sections aligned for easy comparison
- **Change Types**: Different colors for additions, deletions, modifications
- **Navigation**: Easy scrolling through differences

## Change Tracking

### Automatic Change Detection
- **Real-time Tracking**: Changes tracked as you type
- **Granular Detection**: Tracks specific additions, deletions, modifications
- **Content Analysis**: Understands different types of content changes
- **Formatting Changes**: Tracks formatting modifications separately

### Change Visualization
- **Diff Display**: Standard diff format showing changes
- **Color Coding**:
  - Green: Added content
  - Red: Removed content
  - Yellow: Modified content
- **Line-by-line**: Changes shown at line level
- **Context**: Surrounding unchanged content for context

## Restoration and Rollback

### Restoring Versions
1. **Select Version**: Choose version to restore from history
2. **Confirm Action**: System asks for confirmation
3. **New Version**: Restoration creates new version (doesn't delete history)
4. **Editor Update**: Document editor updates with restored content

### Rollback Safety
- **Non-destructive**: Original versions never deleted
- **New Version Creation**: Rollback creates new version
- **Complete History**: Full version history always maintained
- **Reversible**: Can rollback a rollback if needed

## Collaboration Features
